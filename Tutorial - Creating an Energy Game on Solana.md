# [](https://youtu.be/YYQtRCXJBgs?t=0) Introduction to Building an Energy System for a Game on Solana

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker introduces the topic of building an energy system for a game called "Solar Lumberjack" on Solana. The energy system is similar to those found in traditional casual games like Candy Crush, where players have an energy bar that slowly refills over time and is used to perform actions in the game.

## Building the Energy System

- [00:23](https://youtu.be/YYQtRCXJBgs?t=23) Energy systems are common in casual games like Candy Crush.
- [00:42](https://youtu.be/YYQtRCXJBgs?t=42) Solar Lumberjack is based on the Solana app scaffold and can be easily created using `npx create Solana dap`.
- [01:04](https://youtu.be/YYQtRCXJBgs?t=64) The program consists of player data, including name, level, experience, wood, energy, and last login.
- [01:49](https://youtu.be/YYQtRCXJBgs?t=109) The program includes instructions such as initializing a player, chopping a tree (which consumes energy), and updating energy.
- [02:14](https://youtu.be/YYQtRCXJBgs?t=134) The update energy instruction calculates the time passed since the last login and gradually refills the player's energy over time.
- [03:28](https://youtu.be/YYQtRCXJBgs?t=208) When the player's energy reaches maximum capacity, it stops refilling.

## Implementing in the App

- [03:52](https://youtu.be/YYQtRCXJBgs?t=232) The app folder contains an IDL file that represents the program and its instructions.
- [04:37](https://youtu.be/YYQtRCXJBgs?t=277) The shop tree TSX file handles game data retrieval from accounts and displays buttons based on public key availability.
- [05:18](https://youtu.be/YYQtRCXJBgs?t=318) An anchor wallet is created to interact with the program, and the program ID is obtained from anchor build and deploy.
- [05:37](https://youtu.be/YYQtRCXJBgs?t=337) The game state is locked when it changes, and new data is retrieved for the game account.

# Conclusion

The transcript provides an introduction to building an energy system for a game on Solana. It explains the concept of energy systems in casual games and demonstrates how to implement such a system using Solana's app scaffold. The program includes instructions for initializing players, chopping trees (consuming energy), and updating energy over time. The app folder contains files that handle game data retrieval and interaction with the program.

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses the process of initializing the account and player in a game. They mention that a pop-up message prompts the user to initialize their account and add a name for it. Additionally, they explain that when the account changes, a websocket connection is created to the RPC node.

## Account Initialization
- Users are prompted to initialize their account before playing.
- A name can be added to the account during initialization.

## Account Change
- When the account changes, a websocket connection is established with the RPC node.
- Data related to the account change is pushed to update the game state.
- The program's decoder is used to decode player data and set it into the game state.

# [06:40](https://youtu.be/YYQtRCXJBgs?t=400) Updating Energy in Game State

Section Overview: This section focuses on updating energy in the game state. The speaker explains that energy is reset whenever there is a change in game state or time passed. An interval function is used to update energy every second based on certain conditions.

## Energy Update
- Energy reset occurs when there is a change in game state or time passed.
- Timestamps are converted from milliseconds to seconds for calculations.
- If time passed exceeds the time required for energy refill (e.g., 60 seconds), one energy point is added.
- The last login timestamp is updated accordingly.
- A conversion from string to number format may be necessary for proper display of energy values.

# [07:00](https://youtu.be/YYQtRCXJBgs?t=420) Handling Time-based Energy Refill

Section Overview: This section delves into handling time-based energy refill in detail. The speaker explains how intervals are set up and how energy incrementation occurs based on elapsed time.

## Time-based Energy Refill
- An interval function triggers every second to handle energy refill.
- Timestamps are converted from milliseconds to seconds for calculations.
- Time passed is calculated based on the difference between current and last login timestamps.
- Energy is incremented as long as time passed exceeds the time required for energy refill (e.g., 60 seconds).
- The last login timestamp is updated, and energy values are converted to numbers for proper display.

# [07:19](https://youtu.be/YYQtRCXJBgs?t=439) Account Data Representation

Section Overview: This section focuses on representing account data in the game. The speaker explains how the next energy value is automatically updated and displayed in the game interface.

## Account Data Representation
- The next energy value is represented in the game interface.
- On initialization or account change, the next energy value updates automatically.
- The program handles updating and displaying this information.

# [08:03](https://youtu.be/YYQtRCXJBgs?t=483) Initialization Click Event

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker discusses the initialization click event. They explain various checks performed during this event and highlight the usage of different programs like player signer system program and system program.

## Initialization Click Event
- Checks are performed during initialization click event.
- The PDA (Program Derived Address) is obtained, which can be optimized by retrieving it only when there is a change in public key or state.
- Player signer system program and system program are used for creating a new account via cross-program invocation.
- Transaction builder sends out transactions with skip pre-flight set to true for error code visibility on-chain.

# [08:21](https://youtu.be/YYQtRCXJBgs?t=501) Shop Click Event

Section Overview: This section focuses on the shop click event. The speaker explains that similar checks are performed during this event, but without involving the system program.

## Shop Click Event
- Similar checks as in initialization click event are performed during shop click event.
- Player data PDA is obtained.
- The shop tree function is called, subtracting energy and performing other actions.
- The system program is not required for this event.

# [09:14](https://youtu.be/YYQtRCXJBgs?t=554) Building a Mobile Game

Section Overview: In this section, the speaker concludes by discussing the potential of building a mobile game using the concepts explained earlier. They suggest incorporating features like upgrading access, minting tokens, and using gold for upgrades.

## Building a Mobile Game
- Suggestions are given to build a mobile game based on the discussed concepts.
- Features like upgrading access and using tokens and gold are proposed.
- The speaker encourages viewers to explore the provided repository for more information.

# [09:37](https://youtu.be/YYQtRCXJBgs?t=577) Conclusion
